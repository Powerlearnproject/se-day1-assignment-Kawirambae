#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the development and maintenance of software. Its important in the technology indutry become it enhances innovation, allows for the protection of data through cyber security and allows for the development of digital products and services.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The NATO software engineering conference which coined the term and led to the adoption of software development
Rise of object oriented programming with languages like C++ and JAVA which made large scale programming more manageable.
The Aile manifesto in 2001 which priotised flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and requirement
System Design
Implementation (Coding and development)
Testing and Quality Assurance
Deployment and integration
Maintenace and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase—planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment—must be completed before moving on to the next. This structured process makes it difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is finalized. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected modifications. A typical example of its application is in the development of medical device software, where regulatory approvals demand strict documentation and adherence to a structured development process.

In contrast, the Agile methodology follows a flexible, iterative approach, where work is broken down into small increments (sprints) with continuous feedback and improvements. Agile promotes collaboration among developers, testers, and stakeholders, making it ideal for projects with evolving requirements or those requiring rapid deployment. A prime example is the development of mobile apps or SaaS products, where user feedback plays a crucial role in shaping ongoing updates and feature enhancements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code, ensuring that the application functions as intended. They work closely with designers and analysts to implement features that align with project requirements. Additionally, developers focus on debugging and optimizing application performance, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
The Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards through rigorous testing, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests. They identify and report bugs for resolution, helping maintain software reliability. To enhance efficiency, QA engineers also develop automated test scripts, reducing manual testing time while improving accuracy.
The Project Manager oversees the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring that the project stays on track. They allocate resources, set timelines, and monitor progress to meet deadlines. Acting as a bridge between stakeholders, developers, and QA teams, the project manager facilitates effective communication, ensuring that the team works cohesively toward project success.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) play a crucial role in software development by providing a comprehensive set of tools in one place, including a code editor, debugger, compiler, and other essential utilities. By streamlining the development process, IDEs enhance productivity through features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and error checking, making it easier for developers to write and debug code efficiently. Some popular examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and versatile option that supports multiple programming languages, and IntelliJ IDEA, which is specifically optimized for Java development.
Similarly, Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for managing changes in code, enabling developers to track modifications, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions when needed. VCS solutions are particularly valuable for team-based projects, as they facilitate conflict resolution and ensure that code updates are 
seamlessly integrated. One of the most widely used VCS is Git, which powers platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, allowing developers to collaborate in real-time. Another example is Subversion (SVN), which is commonly used in enterprise environments that require a centralized approach to version control.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
One of the most significant difficulties is managing complex codebases, which can become unwieldy over time. To address this, developers should adopt modular programming, maintain clear code documentation, and utilize version control systems like Git to track changes effectively.
Another common challenge is meeting project deadlines, especially when working on large-scale or time-sensitive projects. To stay on track, teams can break work into smaller, manageable sprints using Agile methodologies and leverage project management tools such as JIRA or Trello to monitor progress and assign tasks efficiently.
Debugging and fixing bugs is an inevitable part of software development. To minimize errors, teams should implement thorough testing strategies, use debugging tools, and conduct regular code reviews to identify and resolve issues

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. This ensures that small units of code work as expected before they are integrated into a larger system.
Integration Testing examines how different modules or systems interact with each other. It helps detect interface defects and compatibility issues, ensuring that various components function together seamlessly.
System Testing evaluates the entire system as a whole, verifying that all components work correctly in a unified environment. This phase ensures that the software performs as intended across different workflows and scenarios.
 Acceptance Testing determines whether the software meets user requirements and is ready for deployment. This testing phase is crucial in validating that the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations before it is released into production.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing precise and structured input prompts to optimize responses from AI models like ChatGPT. By crafting well-defined prompts, users can improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses, ensuring they align more closely with their intended goals. Effective prompt engineering helps AI understand context better, leading to more meaningful and efficient interactions. This is particularly valuable in fields such as automated content creation, coding assistance, and chatbot development, where precise instructions are essential for generating high-quality outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt, such as:
"Tell me about AI."
This request is broad and lacks specificity, making it difficult for the AI to determine what aspect of artificial intelligence the user is interested in. The response could range from a general definition of AI to a discussion of its history, applications, or ethical considerations.
An improved prompt could be:
"Explain the key differences between machine learning and deep learning, with examples of real-world applications."
This version is significantly more effective because:
More Specific – It clearly defines the focus on the comparison between machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) rather than AI as a whole.
Contextualized – By requesting real-world examples, it ensures that the response is practical and applicable.
Concise but Clear – It removes ambiguity while maintaining clarity, leading to a more targeted and relevant answer from the AI.
